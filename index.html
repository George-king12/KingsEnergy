    <P id="paragrod">
        With the advancement of technology helping us be more efficient and relaible in the ways in which electric energy is generated and used, yet there are more than a billion people in the developing world on this planet without electricity in their homes to power basic appliences and to help stimulate the local economies. The contribution of constant and relaible energy for developed and the developing countries can not be over looked. Perphaps the main driving catalyst for the indsutral revolution that has strenghened the european and most of the devolped world is the avaibility of energy. This one particular resource in my eyes is the single most important thing every country or economies need to be more productive and efficient in raising the living standards of its citizens. Also development simulies like education, intrastructure , job creation all go hand in hand the avaibility of energy, so the lack thereof has its adverse effect.

        To bring parity and equity to the inequalites we see in the energy sector of the developed world and the developing world, KingsEnergy project aim is to gather funds to provide environmenal friendly, relaible, renewable source of energy for domestic and commercial use where most needed, in the africa continent starting from my home country Ghana. Where there is need , solutions arises and boundaries are broken. To cut the long pitch short, this is the picture am trying to paint.

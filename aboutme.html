				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I have studied business management in college and university but have always been interested in web development. after university i worked the odd jobs to gain skills and expirence. A short while before the pandamic i got an opportunity in the IT field when i did an apprentice working with my uncle as computer engineer. It was a great expirence for me as i did enjoy learning but this was cut short because of the pandamic. My girlfriend ended pregnant and i moved from london to manchester to be closer. soon after my daugher was born i join codeNation to further my learning to achieve my goal of betering mself in the IT sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
